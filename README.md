# Python Village
## Description ##
This is my collection of Python codes that I wrote in solving the [Pyhton Village](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=python-village) problems on [ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/). ROSALIND is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

## INI1_installing_python.py
'''Problem: After downloading and installing Python, type import this into the Python command line and see what happens.'''
## INI2_variables_arithmetic.py
'''Problem: Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.
Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a
and b.
'''
## INI3_strings_lists.py
'''Problem: Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d.
Return: The slice of this string from indices a
through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d]
in our slice.'''
## INI4_conditions_loops.py
'''Problem: Given: Two positive integers a and b (a<b<10000).
Return: The sum of all odd integers from a
through b, inclusively.'''
## INI5_working_with_files.py
'''Given: A file containing at most 1000 lines.
Return: A file containing all the even-numbered lines from the original file. Assume 1-based numbering of lines.
Sample Dataset'''
## INI6_dictionaries.py
'''Problem: Given: A string s of length at most 10000 letters. Return: The number of occurrences of each word in s, where words are separated by spaces. Words are case-sensitive, and the lines in the output can be in any order.'''
